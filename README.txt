IMPORTANT RULES TO HAVE A SMOOTH EXPERIENCE:
1. Don't upload too many images, or images that are too big to the create room form.
2. Only press a button once, and wait for the result. Please don't press any button multiple times quickly.
3. Don't test with multiple players by using separate tabs. We are using HTTTPSession to keep track of players and I think they use cookies.
4. Don't test with only one player, it doesn't work.
5. For any create room field, please don't put in any number that is bigger than 255, or any negative number
6. The lobby phase lasts for 20 seconds, so you gotta make sure all the players have joined the room before then.
7. Have fun with Caption That®!
